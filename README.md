# View Sports Games

My Dad is a huge Red Sox fan and wanted the ability to watch Red Sox games when they came on. I collected a lot of sources that played the links for them, and I made a separate class for every source (inside "lib" folder), and collated & combined them to make an easy user interface for my father to watch any sports team he wanted as it was currently going on. He loves it.

It is in www.newpaltzartist.com/redsox

If you go in the menu, you could choose the team to see and it will play the game
